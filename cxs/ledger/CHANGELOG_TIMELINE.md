## Repository Audit and Standardization

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Event:** Comprehensive CXS repository audit and standardization  
**Details:** Conducted systematic inspection of CXS repo for completeness, domain neutrality, and drop-in readiness. Key activities:

### ‚úÖ Validated Structure
- Confirmed all required directories exist with proper .keep files
- Verified clean organization following CXS standards

### üõ†Ô∏è Created/Fixed Core Files  
- Updated `cycles/current` to contain `sample-cycle`
- Fixed `ledger/runs.csv` header to match specification: `timestamp,session_id,cycle_id,contract_ref,agent_id,tokens_or_runtime,status,notes`

### üìã Created Contract Templates
- `contracts/process.contract` - Generic process execution interface
- `contracts/analyze.contract` - Analysis task standardization  
- `contracts/document.contract` - Documentation generation framework

### üìù Created Standard Prompts
- `prompts/discover.md` - Systematic exploration template
- `prompts/schema_extract.md` - Data schema documentation
- `prompts/policy_apply.md` - Governance compliance framework
- `prompts/cost_discipline.md` - Resource optimization analysis
- `prompts/handoff_note.md` - Knowledge transfer documentation
- `prompts/postmortem.md` - Learning-focused retrospective analysis
- `prompts/verification_checklist.md` - Quality assurance validation

### üèóÔ∏è Created Project Knowledge Templates
- `project/manifest.yaml` - Project metadata and identification
- `project/discover.yaml` - Discovery configuration and parameters
- `project/stack_profile.yaml` - Technology stack documentation
- `project/structure_map.yaml` - Project organization mapping
- `project/functional_requirements.yaml` - Requirements specification
- `project/data_contracts.yaml` - Data schema and interface contracts
- `project/policies.yaml` - Project policies and standards

### üì¶ Created Sample Cycle Pack
- `packs/_sample_cycle/meta.yaml` - Complete cycle pack metadata example with neutral placeholders

### üßπ Domain Neutrality Validation
- Systematically searched for domain-specific terms (NFL, betting, forecasts, etc.)
- Confirmed all content uses neutral, cross-domain language
- Validated existing terms ("model", "legal", "forecast") are used in appropriate neutral contexts

### ‚úÖ Integrity Verification
- All mandatory files exist and contain appropriate content
- File sizes indicate substantial, useful content (not just placeholders)
- Internal references validated for consistency
- README.md properly describes CXS as drop-in infrastructure
- MIT license properly configured

**Outcome:** CXS repository now represents a validated, clean reference implementation that is self-documenting, language-neutral, domain-neutral, and ready to be cloned into any project as baseline Context eXchange System infrastructure.
